241Beats - Honors Project for CS 241
============

##General Idea
Our goal is to build a decentralized music player which plays music on multiple android phones. All these phones will use play a single playlist shared playlist that can be edited by any phone. Furthermore, playback on all phones will be synchroned so that all phones play the same music at all times. This also means that any phone can control music (pause / skip / etc) on all other phones.
